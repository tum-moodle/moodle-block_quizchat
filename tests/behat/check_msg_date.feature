  Scenario: check quizchat message date
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > View" page
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I set the field "block_quizchat_input_instructor_send" to "This is my first message."
    And I press "Send"
    Then I should see "This is my first message."
    And I should see "Today"
    And the last quizchat message date is set to "5" days back
    And I reload the page
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I should not see "Today"
    And I should see "5" days back in the selector ".line-with-text"
    And I copy the last quizchat message "2" times 
    And I reload the page
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I should not see "Today"
    And I should see "5" days back in the selector ".line-with-text"
    And I set the field "block_quizchat_input_instructor_send" to "This is my second message."
    And I press "Send"
    Then I should see "This is my second message."
    And I should see "Today"
    And I should see "5" days back in the selector ".line-with-text"
