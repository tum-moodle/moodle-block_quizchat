Feature: Sorting messages in Quizchat block in fullscreen view
    In order to ensure no messages are overlooked and providing a more structured communication flow in Quizchat block
    As an Instructor (a user with "sendall" capabaility)
    I should be able to clearly differentiate between private and group conversations,
    to be notified of new messages in real time and clearly see which conversation the new message belongs to,
    and view messages of each conversation separately for a more focused discussion experience.
